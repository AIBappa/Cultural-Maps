This is a sample project for demonstrating the cultural maps in Maharashtra using OSM.

Local Dev environment:
Windows 10 with WSL (Debian)

For recreating local dev environment, following steps are required:
1) Run the reinstall-script.sh to install all the Debian packages required.
2) Run the requirements.txt file to install all the Python packages via pip in a virtual environment.
3) Backend code is based on Django and DRF, so use python3 manage.py runserver at the WSL prompt to run the localserver.
4) If issues found, add them to the Issues tab in Github and they will be looked at hopefully, eventually :)
